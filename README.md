INTRODUCTION
As a graduate student in Business Analytics and a Summa Cum Laude Honors Bachelor of Science graduate in Business Information Systems from The University of Texas at Arlington (GPA: 4.00), I bring a strong foundation in both business and technology. During my tenure as a Java Developer at Bank of America, I showcased my technical and problem-solving abilities by contributing to software development projects within Agile SDLC environments. My skill set includes integrating MySQL databases, managing version control with Git and GitHub, and leveraging project management tools such as Jira.
Beyond my technical acumen, I served as a Mavericks Orientation Leader, guiding new students and presenting campus services. As a Math Tutor at Dallas College, I fostered an encouraging learning environment for various math concepts. My skill set spans Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, MySQL Workbench, Tableau, SAP-ERP, financial modeling, and data analysis, bolstered by certifications in Social Media Marketing.

In my role as Marketing/Social Media Chair for Mavs Go Green, I organized sustainable campus activities, significantly increasing audience engagement on social media. I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and am excited to bring my skills, achievements, and commitment to excellence to new challenges in the Information Systems domain.

In this repo you can some of the works I have done to showcase my skillsets as a Business Analyst.
