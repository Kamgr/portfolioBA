A SQL-based inventory and sales tracking system designed for cafés selling ready-to-drink (RTD) beverages. This project automates stock management, tracks vendor purchases, and calculates sales profit—giving decision-makers real-time insight into product performance.

##  Why This Project?

As a Business Analyst, I built this project to solve real-world problems:

- **Which vendors supply the most products?**
- **What’s the profit on each drink?**
- **How can operations be automated to reduce manual tracking?**

##  Features

-  **Inventory Tracking** – Real-time updates via SQL triggers  
-  **Profit Analysis** – Sales vs. cost by product or date range  
-  **Vendor Management** – Contact & performance tracking  
-  **Time-Based Reporting** – Sales and purchases by timestamp  
-  **Automation** – Self-updating inventory after each sale or purchase

##  Tech Stack

- **Database**: SQLite  
- **Language**: SQL  
- **Business Logic**: Triggers, Relationships, Normalized Schema

##  Business Analyst Value

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Design scalable systems from real business needs
